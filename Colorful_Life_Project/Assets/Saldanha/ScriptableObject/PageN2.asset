  _content: 'It''s thanksgiving in a few days.

    This year was disastrous...
    But I

    survived. I have no clue how, but I

    did.

    These... marks
    on my body... I regret

    them now. I regret hurting myself. I

    regret
    hurting my friends and family.

    I regret not living the life I found

    out
    I wanted to, and causing problems

    to people around me.

    How am I supposed
    to give thanks if

    I''m filled with this... this poison.

    This . Guilt

    It''s
    corroding me from the inside out,

    and I just can''t stop feeling mad for

    allowing
    it to slowly consume me.

    That''s it. I had enough.

    This is MY life,
    and this will NOT

    kill me.'
