  _content: "Look at the rain... It hits the window\r\n of the car, and it drops
    down leaving\r\na trail that resembles the tears that\r\n I almost every day
    shed here after\r\n leaving work.\r\n Life's funny. I woke up so energetic\r\n
    today, promised myself to be\r\n productive and to make it work... And\r\n look
    where I ended. Like always. So\r\n predictable.\r\n Honestly, I'm tired of filling
    this\r\n diary with the same shit everyday. I\r\n don't even understand why I'm
    writing\r\n this.\r\n Well, that's enough. Time to put a\r\n happy face and go
    have dinner with the\r\n boys. Hope my freaking anxiety allows\r\n me to have
    some fun tonight."
