  _content: "It's summer, and I had my first\r\n refreshing morning in a good while.\r\n
    Took a shower, walked on the park, had\r\n breakfast with one of my friends.
    It\r\nactually made me feel something, after\r\n all.\r\n I don't know what it
    was, but I felt\r\nit... For a small period of time, of\r\n course.\r\n My cousin
    showed up at my house on the\r\n afternoon and start blabbering about\r\n her
    life.\r\n It was interesting in the beginning,\r\n but after a while I completely
    lost\r\npatience and said some mean stuff to\r\n her.\r\n Why did I do that?
    Sincerely, I have\r\n no clue. This weird feeling started\r\n burning as if something
    threw gasoline\r\n on top of a big fire.\r\n I lost control of my thoughts, and\r\n
    this fire, this , insulted her Anger\r\n for nothing.\r\n I guess I'm just a
    loser...\n\n\n\n\r\n ...... aren't I?"
